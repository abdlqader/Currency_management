# Sanad Technical Task Project

This is a technical task project developed for **Sanad**.

## üß† Tech Choices

- **Redis** was chosen for in-memory data storage over using a simple in-memory `HashMap` inside the Spring Boot application. Redis provides significant advantages:
    - **Persistence options**, enabling in-memory data to survive restarts if configured.
    - **Better performance** and memory management for large-scale or concurrent data access.
    - **Decoupling** from JVM lifecycle, which allows sharing data across services or applications if needed.

## ‚úÖ Project Features

- All technical requirements of the task have been implemented.
- Unit tests are included, though minor improvements or additional coverage might be beneficial.

## üîó Project URLs
